# Pinia Workshop

This codebase is used for the Pinia Workshop by Vanessa Otto. The project is built with Vite and Vue 3.

This project uses TypeScript, with `allowJs` set to `true`. Therefore you can use Vanilla JavaScript. However, we recommend trying to use TypeScript to see the full power of Vue 3 + Pinia and TypeScript in combination.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

The configuration of this project includes ESLint and prettier. I recommend the following settings in VS Code:

```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
"[vue]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
},
